  // (THROW would also be a barrier if we had something like that).
  // Any compound statement that unavoidably hits a barrier is itself a
  // barrier: IF/ELSEIF/ELSE with barriers in all branches; SWITCH with no
  // breaks and a barrier at the end; TRY with a barrier in either the code
  // block or the FINALLY clause; and infinite loops with no break.
  // Note that most looping constructs cannot be barriers, due to the
  // possibility of the loop executing zero times and just falling thru.
  // Note that function calls cannot be a barrier, not even abort(), due
  // to the existence of the "disable" CLI command.  The code currently
  // assumes that no expression can be a barrier.
  // Note that BREAK and CONTINUE are disallowed outside of loops, so the
  // presence of a barrier in a non-void function's body is exactly
  // equivalent to the requirement that it not return without a return value.
