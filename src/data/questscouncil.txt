questL02Larva	started	We require your aid, Adventurer. We need a mosquito larva. Don't ask why, because we won't tell you. In any case, the best place to find a mosquito larva is in the Spooky Forest, which is found in the Distant Woods. We'll mark it on your map for you.	We still need a mosquito larva, Adventurer. Please find us one, in the Spooky Forest.
questL02Larva	finished	Thanks for the larva, Adventurer. Er, actually, y'know what? You look pretty lonely. Maybe you should hatch this larva and keep the mosquito as a pet.<p>To do so, you'll need a Familiar-Gro&trade; Terrarium at your campsite. You can use this Meat to buy one, if you don't already have one.	Thanks for the larva, Adventurer. We'll put this to good use. Have some Meat for your troubles.
questL03Rat	started	We've received word that the owner of The Typical Tavern, in The Distant Woods, is having a bit of a rat problem. I'm sure he'd reward you if you took care of it for him.	The owner of the Typical Tavern is still bugging us about his rat problems. Perhaps you could help him?
questL04Bat	started	The Council requires another task of you, Adventurer. You must slay the Boss Bat. He can be found in the deepest part of the Bat Hole, in the Nearby Plains. Slay him, and return to us with proof of your conquest.	You have not yet slain the Boss Bat. He can be found in the Bat Hole, in the Nearby Plains.
questL04Bat	finished	Well done! You have slain the Boss Bat. As a reward, we present you with this belt made from his skin.
questL05Goblin	started	We've gotten word, Adventurer, that the Knob Goblins, who normally keep to themselves over at Cobb's Knob, are planning a major military action against Seaside Town.<p>We need for you to go deep into the Knob, and nip this problem in the bud, so to speak, by neutralizing the Goblin King.<p>Our spies have determined that there is a secret entrance that will allow you to access the inside of the Knob. They recovered this map, but nobody knows how to read it.<p>You'll need to figure out how to decrypt the symbols on it if you're going to find that entrance. And be careful with it, Adventurer. Many Bothans died to... oh, wait, never mind. That was something else.	You need to find your way into Cobb's Knob, Adventurer. Try looking around the Outskirts for a clue that might help you figure out that map we gave you.	We still need you to neutralize the Goblin King, Adventurer.
questL05Goblin	finished	Thank you for slaying the Goblin King, Adventurer.
questL06Friar	started	Please, Adventurer, help us! We were performing a ritual at our Infernal Gate, and Brother Starfish dropped the butterknife. All of the infernal creatures escaped our grasp, and have tainted our grove. Please clean the taint! Collect the three items necessary to perform the ritual which will banish these fiends back to their own realm.<p>The first item can probably be found in The Dark Neck of the Woods.<p>The second item was last seen in The Dark Heart of the Woods.<p>The third item was stolen near The Dark Elbow of the Woods.	You don't appear to have all of the elements necessary to perform the ritual.	You've got all three of the ritual items, Adventurer! Hurry to the center of the circle, and perform the ritual!
questL07Cyrptic	started	Recently, an aura of extreme Spookiness has begun to emanate from within the Cyrpt, near the Misspelled Cemetary. We fear that some horrible monster has taken up residence there, and begun to rile up the local undead.<p>Would you be so good as to investigate? This device should help:	The Spookiness still emanates from the Cyrpt, Adventurer. See if you can find and destroy the source, and bring us back proof of your conquest.
questL07Cyrptic	finished	Aha! So the Spookiness was coming from this abominable creature, was it? Well, you have our thanks, Adventurer, for your courageous act of undefilement.<p>Please, allow us to fashion that skull into something a little flashier.
questL08Trapper	started	Adventurer! We've received an urgent letter from the L337 Tr4pz0r, requesting our assistance. We're, like, really busy right now, so we were hoping you could go out to his place and see what he wants.<p>He lives at the base of Mt. McLargeHuge, the tallest of the Big Mountains. We'll mark it on your map for you.	You still have unfinished business with the L337 Tr4pz0r, Adventurer.
questL09Lol	started	Adventurer! We've just received an urgent message from the Baron Rof L'm Fao. His Valley, beyond the Orc Chasm in the Big Mountains, has been invaded! You must help him!	The Baron Rof L'm Fao still needs your help, Adventurer! You can find his valley beyond the Orc Chasm, in the Big Mountains.<p>If you're having trouble getting past the Chasm, the pirates on the Mysterious Island of Mystery might have something that will help you.
questL09Lol	step1	Now that you've found your way into the Valley beyond the Orc Chasm, you'll have to find the gates of the Baron's keep. They're cleverly hidden, though. You'll need your wits and your arithmetic skills about you if you're going to find them.
questL10Garbage	started	Something is amiss, Adventurer. The Nearby Plains are filling up with giant piles of garbage, and despite our best efforts, it keeps falling from the sky faster than we can clean it up. We need you to figure out where it's coming from, and put a stop to it.	Please try to figure out where this garbage is coming from, Adventurer! Perhaps you can find a clue by poking around the Nearby Plains.
questL10Garbage	finished	We're not sure what you did, Adventurer, but the garbage finally stopped falling. Thanks a lot!<p>Oh, by the way -- we found this in the garbage when we were cleaning up, and thought you might have some use for it.
questL11MacGuffin	started	You can travel there from the Travel Agency at The Shore, but there's a slight hitch -- the area you're going to requires a passport for entry, and our passport offices are temporarily closed due to a tiny photograph shortage. You'll need to acquire some forged identification documents from the Black Market instead, but we're not entirely sure where the Black Market actually is. It's probably near the Black Forest, though, and we'll mark that on your map for you.	Any luck getting your father's diary and recovering the Holy MacGuffin? It's a pretty important whatchamacallit, so we'd apprecate it if you'd get on that right away.
questL11MacGuffin	finished	And one quick (though enjoyable) tickertape parade later, you're standing back in front of the Council Hall, picking bits of confetti out of your hair and wondering what you should do next.
questL12War	started	Adventurer, we have heard rumors that trouble is brewing on the Mysterious Island of Mystery. The hippies and frat boys are agitating for war. I mean, they've always been a little tense with each other, but now it's getting serious. We couldn't be happier.<p>We'd like you to go over there and make sure that war starts. We don't care how it starts and we don't care who wins. Maybe the hippies will wipe out the frat boys, or maybe the frat boys will annihilate the hippies, or maybe they'll eradicate each other. It's kind of like watching two hot girls mud-wrestle -- no matter who loses, we win.	Hey, have you managed to start the war on the Mysterious Island yet? If you can't get them sufficiently worked up, try assassinating Franz Ferdinand. Historically, that tends to work.
questL12War	step1	Excellent work, adventurer! You've finally managed to get those idiots to fight each other. Now you've got to make sure the battle ends before the tourist season. I mean, would you rather go visit the "beautiful tropical island" or the "body-strewn war zone?"
questL12War	finished	Here you go -- you're now a decorated war hero. Don't let it go to your head. 
questL13Final	started	Now that you have proven yourself, the Council has deemed that it is time for you to embark upon your final quest. Seek out and destroy the Naughty Sorceress, who has plagued these lands for so long, and rescue King Ralph XI, whom she has imprismed.<p>Go forth to her Lair, east of the Nearby Plains! Beat her down!	Be strong, Adventurer! You must defeat the Naughty Sorceress! You'll find her Lair just east of the Nearby Plains.
questL13Final	finished	Congratulations, Adventurer! It's the end of your quest as we know it. Don't worry, we feel fine. You've freed the king and made us obsolete. Ah, well. Hail to the king, baby.
