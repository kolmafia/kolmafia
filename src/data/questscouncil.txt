questL02Larva	started	We require your aid, Adventurer. We need a mosquito larva. Don't ask why, because we won't tell you. In any case, the best place to find a mosquito larva is in the Spooky Forest, which is found in the Distant Woods. We'll mark it on your map for you.	We still need a mosquito larva, Adventurer. Please find us one, in the Spooky Forest.
questL02Larva	finished	Thanks for the larva, Adventurer. Er, actually, y'know what? You look pretty lonely. Maybe you should hatch this larva and keep the mosquito as a pet.<p>To do so, you'll need a Familiar-Gro&trade; Terrarium at your campsite. You can use this Meat to buy one, if you don't already have one.	Thanks for the larva, Adventurer. We'll put this to good use.
questL03Rat	started	We've received word that the owner of The Typical Tavern, in The Distant Woods, is having a bit of a rat problem. I'm sure he'd reward you if you took care of it for him.	The owner of the Typical Tavern is still bugging us about his rat problems. Perhaps you could help him?
questL04Bat	started	The Council requires another task of you, Adventurer. You must slay the Boss Bat. He can be found in the deepest part of the Bat Hole, in the Nearby Plains. Slay him, and return to us with proof of your conquest.	You have not yet slain the Boss Bat. He can be found in the Bat Hole, in the Nearby Plains.
questL04Bat	finished	Well done! You have slain the Boss Bat. As a reward, we present you with this belt made from his skin.
questL05Goblin	started	We've gotten word, Adventurer, that the Knob Goblins, who normally keep to themselves over at Cobb's Knob, are planning a major military action against Seaside Town.<p>We need for you to go deep into the Knob, and nip this problem in the bud, so to speak, by neutralizing the Goblin King.<p>Our spies have determined that there is a secret entrance that will allow you to access the inside of the Knob. They recovered this map, but nobody knows how to read it.<p>You'll need to figure out how to decrypt the symbols on it if you're going to find that entrance. And be careful with it, Adventurer. Many Bothans died to... oh, wait, never mind. That was something else.	You need to find your way into Cobb's Knob, Adventurer. Try looking around the Outskirts for a clue that might help you figure out that map we gave you.	We still need you to neutralize the Goblin King, Adventurer!
questL05Goblin	finished	Thank you for slaying the Goblin King, Adventurer.
questL06Friar	started	The Deep Fat Friars in the Distant Woods are having a problem -- one of the experiments has gone awry, and fey creatures have invaded their grove. Please, Adventurer, lend them your assistance.	The Deep Fat Friars still require your assistance. You can find them in the Distant Woods.
questL07Cyrptic	started	Recently, an aura of extreme Spookiness has begun to emanate from within the Cyrpt, near the Misspelled Cemetary. We fear that some horrible monster has taken up residence there, and begun to rile up the local undead.<p>Would you be so good as to investigate? This device should help:	The Spookiness still emanates from the Cyrpt, Adventurer. See if you can find and destroy the source, and bring us back proof of your conquest.
questL07Cyrptic	finished	Aha! So the Spookiness was coming from this abominable creature, was it? Well, you have our thanks, Adventurer, for your courageous act of undefilement.<p>Please, allow us to fashion that skull into something a little flashier.
questL08Trapper	started	Adventurer! We've received an urgent letter from the Trapper, requesting our assistance. We're, like, really busy right now, so we were hoping you could go out to his place and see what he wants.<p>He lives at the base of Mt. McLargeHuge, the tallest of the Big Mountains. We'll mark it on your map for you.	You still have unfinished business with the Trapper, Adventurer.
questL09Topping	started	Sorry to trouble you with this, Adventurer, but we've gotten a... shall we say... cryptic message from Black Angus -- he's one of Loathing's minor nobles.<p>It's usually safe to ignore him, but he sounded pretty agitated, and given the current political climate we can scarcely afford to ignore him.<p>Could you do us a favor and go to his tower, in the Highlands?  The Highlands are just on the other side of the Orc Chasm.  We'll mark it on your map.	The Highland Lord, Black Angus, still needs your help, Adventurer.
questL10Garbage	started	Something is amiss, Adventurer. The Nearby Plains are filling up with giant piles of garbage, and despite our best efforts, it keeps falling from the sky faster than we can clean it up. We need you to figure out where it's coming from, and put a stop to it.	Please try to figure out where this garbage is coming from, Adventurer! Perhaps you can find a clue by poking around the Nearby Plains.
questL10Garbage	finished	We're not sure what you did, Adventurer, but the garbage finally stopped falling.  Thanks a lot!<p>Oh, by the way -- we found this in the garbage when we were cleaning up, and thought you might have some use for it.
questL11MacGuffin	started	You can travel there from the Travel Agency at The Shore, but there's a slight hitch -- the area you're going to requires a passport for entry, and our passport offices are temporarily closed due to a tiny photograph shortage. You'll need to acquire some forged identification documents from the Black Market instead, but we're not entirely sure where the Black Market actually is. It's probably near the Black Forest, though, and we'll mark that on your map for you.	Any luck getting your father's diary and recovering the Holy MacGuffin? It's a pretty important whatchamacallit, so we'd appreciate it if you'd get on that right away.
questL11MacGuffin	finished	And one quick (though enjoyable) tickertape parade later, you're standing back in front of the Council Hall, picking bits of confetti out of your hair and wondering what you should do next.
questL12War	started	Adventurer, we have heard rumors that trouble is brewing on the Mysterious Island of Mystery. The hippies and frat boys are agitating for war. I mean, they've always been a little tense with each other, but now it's getting serious. We couldn't be happier.<p>We'd like you to go over there and make sure that war starts. We don't care how it starts and we don't care who wins. Maybe the hippies will wipe out the frat boys, or maybe the frat boys will annihilate the hippies, or maybe they'll eradicate each other. It's kind of like watching two hot girls mud-wrestle -- no matter who loses, we win.	Hey, have you managed to start the war on the Mysterious Island yet? If you can't get them sufficiently worked up, try assassinating Franz Ferdinand. Historically, that tends to work.
questL12War	step1	Excellent work, adventurer! You've finally managed to get those idiots to fight each other. Now you've got to make sure the battle ends before the tourist season. I mean, would you rather go visit the "beautiful tropical island" or the "body-strewn war zone?"
questL12War	finished	Here you go -- you're now a decorated war hero. Don't let it go to your head. 
questL13Final	started	Now that you have proven yourself, the Council has deemed that it is time for you to embark upon your final quest. Seek out and destroy the Naughty Sorceress, who has plagued these lands for so long, and rescue King Ralph XI, whom she has imprismed.<p>Go forth to her Lair, east of the Nearby Plains! Beat her down!	Be strong, Adventurer! You must defeat the Naughty Sorceress! You'll find her Lair just east of the Nearby Plains.
questL13Final	finished	Congratulations, Adventurer! It's the end of your quest as we know it. Don't worry, we feel fine. You've freed the king and made us obsolete. Ah, well. Hail to the king, baby.

# Sneaky Pete
questL02Larva	started	Uh, hey, dude, we could use some help if you're not mad busy. We need a mosquito larva. We won't bore you with our totes lame reasons why. You can find them in the Spooky Forest, in the Distant Woods. We'd be hella salty grateful if you could snag us one, yo.	Hey, homes, we still need that mosquito larva. We'll totally do your math homework for you if you get one for us! It's in the Spooky Forest.
questL02Larva	finished	Sweet! Thanks for getting the larva for us. That was totes chill of you.
questL03Rat	started	S'up, righteous dude. I know this isn't really worthy of your mad skills, but the owner of the Typical Tavern in the Distant Woods is trippin' about some rodent problem. I'm sure he'd give you mad props if you totes knocked 'em out.
questL04Bat	started	Hey, uh, homes. What's up? Any drama in the LBC? Heh, so we've got this grody Boss Bat who is, uh, sweating us to the max. If you're not too busy, like, could you throw some smack on him? He lives in the deepest part of the Bat Hole, in the nearby plains. So, y'know, cowabunga!	Hey, sis, I'm not trying to stress you, dawg, but I have to be "The Man" here and point out the Boss Bat is still alive. Which is not tubular, you know? Scope him out at the Bat Hole, by the Nearby Plains.
questL04Bat	finished	Hey, uh, dog, it was poppin' fresh how you iced the Boss Bat! We made this belt out of his skin for you. I mean, I know it's totally lame, but you can have it.
questL05Goblin	started	Hey, dude, we just got the 411 that the Knob Goblins are all panty-twisted and totes want to attack Seaside Town. What a bunch of douchegrass, am I right?<p>We think it's time some righteous bro went into the Knob and took out the Goblin King.<p>Our spies found out about a secret entrance that'll let you get all up ins. They found this map, but it's mad encrypted.<p>So could you, y'know, in your spare time, maybe poke around and see if you can get in there? You'd be doing us a solid. Peace out.	Yo, home...stuck?, we still really need you to get into Cobb's Knob, y'know, if you've got the time. You can probably find a clue on the Outskirts for how to get in.	Hey, I saw that the Goblin King is still stompin' around, yo. Have you not had a chance to get jiggy on him yet?
questL05Goblin	finished	You totally knocked that Goblin King out like a punk. Tubular work!
questL06Friar	started	Hey, homeskittle, those lameoid Deep Fat Friars opened some kind of weird portal, and all kinds of grody to the max demons are invading their grove. It would be totes, uh, dope if you could help them out.	Hey, daddy-o, those wack demons are still bothering those fuddy-duddy Friars. If, y'know, you feel like it, you should help them out in the Distant Woods.
questL07Cyrptic	started	Uh, what's up, homeboy? We hate to bother you, but there's, like, mad Spookiness coming out of the Cyrpt, near the Misspelled Cematary in the Nearby Plains. Some total dweeboid monster is probably in there, riling up the undead. It'd be totes sweet if you could check it out for us.<p>This thing will probably help -- we don't know, it's probably some nerd stuff, so whatever -- but, uh, could you look into it? If you've got time?	Yo, uh, home...slice? Is that what you kids say? Um, anyway, the Cyrpt is still super Spooky--I mean, I'm sure you're busy with cool stuff, like, being a cool guy, you know, but could you please get rid of the source, and bring back proof you did it? I mean, we trust you, but...yeah.
questL07Cyrptic	finished	Wow, so this was the crumbum Spookying up the Cyrpt? Looks like you, uh, totes dealt with him.<p>Here, let us make that skull into something badass enough for you to wear. 
questL08Trapper	started	S'up, homeslice? I know you're busy doing cool stuff, but we just got a letter from the Trapper, and he's got 99 problems. Could you maybs check out whatever tip he's on? That'd be mad awesome.<p>He lives at the base of Mt. McLargeHuge, the tallest of the Big Mountains. We'll mark it on your map for you.	I don't want to tell you your business, homeskittle, but the Trapper's still freaking out about whatever. You should probs check it out.
questL09Topping	started	Hey, dawg, sorry to bother you with this, but we just got a wack-ass message from Black Angus, this, like, wannabe royal.<p>Usually, we just let him talk all the jabber he wants, but he sounds totes off his rock this time.<p>Could you go get the 411 on what his damage is? His pad is in the Highlands, just around the Orc Chasm. We'll map it up for you.	Hey, dude, Black Angus is still mad tripping about whatever tip he's on. You should totes hit him up.
questL10Garbage	started	S'up, dude. The Nearby Plains are filling up with these totally unhip and wack piles of garbage. If you've got time, could you see where it's coming from and put a stop to it? That'd be tight.	We don't want to be, like, a bunch of fascist squares or anything, but the garbage is still falling from the sky over in the Nearby Plains. So, uh, what's up with that?
questL10Garbage	finished	Wow, you totally got jiggy with that whole garbage situation, homes! That's what the kids say, right? "Got jiggy" means "got it done?"<p>Anyway, we found this thing while we were cleaning up. It looked like something you could maybe use.
questL11MacGuffin	started	You can get it if you take your whip to the Travel Agency at The Shore, but they're totally going to sweat you unless you have a passport. You should, uh, hit up the Black Market for some bogus creds. We're sure you know where that is, but we're not cool enough to get told, so we'll just send you to the Black Forest and you can get there from there.<p>Once you've got ol' fossil dad's book, you could track down the MacGuffin for us, if you don't have anything better to do. It'll probs help us defeat the Sorceress, so, you know. Whatever.	Hey, dude, have you had a chance to scope the deets on the Holy Watchamacallit yet? We could really use it, so it'd be proppa if you could get on that.
questL11MacGuffin	finished	And one quick (though enjoyable) tickertape parade later, you're standing back in front of the Council Hall, picking bits of confetti out of your hair and wondering what you should do next.
questL12War	started	Hey, homes, we've heard some downlow intel that peeps on the Mysterious Island of Mystery are getting salty with each other. Those wacked-out hippies and gnarly frat boys seem about to start a war. I mean, those dudes don't really chill together regardless, but now they're thirsty for blood. Hella thirsty. This seems like a good time to really spark some stuff.<p>If you have time, could you scope out the sitch and make sure the war starts? It doesn't matter who wins or how it starts, just set it off.<p>Maybe the hippies will wipe out the frat boys, or maybe the frat boys will annihilate the hippies, or maybe they'll eradicate each other. It's kind of like watching two hot girls mud-wrestle -- no matter who loses, we win. Word.	Yo, homestar, have you got the war started on the island yet? If you can't heat things up, try assassinating Franz Ferdinand. That would totes twist some panties.
questL12War	step1	Man, you're tearing it up on the island, adventurer! Totally radical and gnarly! You've got those idiots, like, hella salty fighting each other. Now you've just got to end the war before those lame dork tourists start showing up.<p>Nah, you don't have to fight for one side in particular, dawg. We're not going to be all fascist and say what side to join. Heck, take out both sides! That'd be dope!<p>If you get bored doing this stuff--I mean, we know the world bores you when you're cool--you could chat up some of the other people who live on the island. Most of 'em are dweebs, but some might be able to help. Take it easy, brah!
questL12War	finished	That was totes gnarly, adventurer! You totally beat down those dweeboid hippies. The tourists are going to enjoy not having to hold their noses while they buy their lame, pointless souvenirs!<p>If only you had taken out those douchey frat boys, too. Oh, well. At least their margaritas are hella tight.<p>Wear this with pride--or, y'know, cool indifference.
questL13Final	started	You are seriously one bad mutha--sorry, I'll shut my mouth. The Council thinks you're ready to step up to that crazy sheila who's responsible for all this nonsense. Go lay some knowledge on that nonsense! Drop her like she's hot! Bounce her like a bad check! And free King Ralph, y'know, if you get around to it.<p>Go scope out her Lair, east of the Nearby Plains! Beat her down!	Yo, friend-o, the Naughty Sorceress is still out there going crazy on the murderous tip! You gots to totes drop her! She's in her Lair, east of the Nearby Plains!	Congratulations, bromide! You straight up 86'd the Naughty Sorceress and made all the wack daddies out there chill. Say, did you know she was your mother?<p>Nah, just messin' with you. But hey, you totes left the king imprismed up there. It'd be straight-up hella ignorant if you left him up there, because the monsters would keep on sweatin' the whole land and we'd be in absolute power still. Yup, that'd be some crazy messed-up plumbing.<p>You should probs let him fly, though. But, y'know, take your time. Comb your 'do, spiff your campsite, ghost ride your whip, whatever.<p>Seriously, no rush
