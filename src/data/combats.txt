# Combat percentage figures from Yiab's statistical data:
#
# http://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Parseable_Area_Statistics
#
# Missing Combat Percent Data (marked with -1):
#
# All monsters are usually equally likely to appear. For those areas
# where some monsters are more heavily weighted than others, specify the
# relative weights for each monster in the area following a colon:
#
#     monster1: 2 monster2: 3
#
# says that for every five combat encounters in the area, 2 will be
# monster 1 and 3 will be monster 2.
#
# A weight of 0 means this is choice adventure generated, semi-rare or
# one-time (boss) encounter in the area. A weight of -1 means this is an
# ultra-rare encounter. Neither type of monster will be included in
# average XP calculations.
#
# The weight can be followed by an "o" to indicate that that the monster
# can only appear in your first and subsequent odd-numbered ascensions,
# or "e" if it can only appear in even-numbered ascensions.
#
# The weight can be followed by an "r" to indicate a rejection condition,
# and then the % chance of rejection following
