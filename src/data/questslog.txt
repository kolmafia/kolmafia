That should help make your desert explorations a little less... dry.	The fremegn leader Gnasir has tasked you with finding a stone rose, at his abandoned encampment near the oasis. Apparently it's an ancient symbol of his tribe or something, I dunno, whatever. He's not gonna help you unless you get it for him, though.	Gnasir has asked you to prove your honor and dedication to the tribe by painting his front door black. A menial task to be sure, but at least it's not dangerous.<p>Well, unless you're really allergic to paint fumes or something.

An inscription provides a clue on how you might pass through them...	Having made it through the three gates, you've encountered a giant mirror that blocks your way deeper into the Lair.	You've come to an odd junction in the cave leading to the Sorceress' Lair. It seems that in order to proceed, you'll need to solve a really convoluted and contrived puzzle involving a cloud of gas, a locked door, and three statues of mariachis.	The Council of Loathing has instructed you to make your way to the top of the Naughty Sorceress' Tower and defeat her. Currently, you're stuck in a hedge maze, Don't beat around the bush, get through it!	You've passed through the gates, solved a fiendish puzzle, beat the hedge maze like a psychotic landscaper, and now you're facing a fiendish monster on the	You've solved many puzzles, and now are confronted with the most frustrating puzzle yet. Can you figure out the code to get through the heavy door?	You're almost to the final epic showdown battle countdown of fate and destiny and whatnot! Get in there and kick some tail!

# Guild Quests
questG01Meatcar	My Other Car Is Made of Meat	Since your Guild's meat car has been lost due to somewhat sketchy circumstances, you need to build a new one. You might be able to find some parts at Degrassi Knoll.	You've built a new meat car from parts. Impressive!
questG02Whitecastle	<Player Name> and <Familiar Name> Go To White Citadel	You've been charged by your Guild (sort of) with the task of bringing back a delicious meal from the legendary White Citadel. You've been told it's somewhere near Whitey's Grove, in the Distant Woods.	You've discovered the road from Whitey's Grove to the legendary White Citadel. You should explore it and see if you can find your way.	You're progressing down the road towards the White Citadel, but you'll need to find something that can help you get past that stupid cheetah if you're going to make it any further. Keep looking around.	You've made your way further down the Road to the White Citadel, but you still haven't found it. Keep looking!	You've found the White Citadel, but it's at the bottom of a huge cliff. You should keep messing around on the Road until you find a way to get down the cliff.

Much as you expected, you've been given back the key to Fernswarthy's tower and ordered to investigate.	You've unlocked Fernswarthy's tower. Now you just have to find something to show your guild leaders, to prove you haven't just been slacking off this whole time.	You've found some stairs in Fernswarthy's tower, but they don't lead to much. Better keep looking.	You've found a trapdoor to Fernswarthy's basement, which is potentially interesting and/or dangerous. It's probably not what your Guild is interested in, though, so you should probably keep looking.	You found some kind of dusty old book in Fernswarthy's tower. Hopefully that's enough to keep that guy in your guild off your case.	You've turned in the old book, and they said they didn't want it and for you to go away. A bit anticlimactic, but I suppose it still counts as a success. Congratulations!
questG04Nemesis	Me and My Nemesis	One of your guild leaders has tasked you to recover a mysterious and unnamed artifact stolen by your Nemesis. Your first step is to smith an Epic Weapon.<p>Two parts of the Epic Weapon can be had from the two oldest and wisest men in the kingdom, one of whom runs the casino. You weren't told where the third part is.	Despite being aided by <demon name>, the Demonic Lord of Revenge, the Infernal Seal Gorgolok has fallen beneath your mighty assault.

Now the people of the Kingdom of Loathing are safe from whatever horrible (and probably really gross) scheme it was that Lumpy had in store! Your mother must be very proud of you. Well done!	Despite being aided by <demon name>, the Demonic Lord of Revenge, the Spirit of New Wave has fallen beneath your mighty assault. Now the disco-loving people of the Kingdom of Loathing are free to groove the night away, safe from his insidious machinations! Your mother must be very proud of you. Well done!	Despite being aided by <demon name>, the Demonic Lord of Revenge, the dread mariachi Somerset Lopez has fallen beneath your mighty assault. Now the eons-long war between the Accordion Thieves and the mariachis is finally at an end, and the streets of the Kingdom of Loathing are safe for cat-burglars and sneak-thieves like yourself and your cronies! Your mother must be very proud of you. Well done!
questG05Dark	A Dark and Dank and Sinister Quest	Finally it's time to meet this Nemesis you've been hearing so much about! The guy at your guild has marked your map with the location of a cave in the Big Mountains, where your Nemesis is supposedly hiding.	Your Nemesis has scuttled away in defeat, leaving you with a sweet Epic Hat and a feeling of smug superiority. Well done you!
questG06Delivery	<Player Name>'s Delivery Service	A guy in your guild has offered you some meat if you'll grab his package for him.<p>Oh stop laughing, you know perfectly well what I mean! Honestly...<p>Anyway, you should be able to find it in the 7-Foot Dwarves' factory complex, which can supposedly be reached through their mine.	You've successfully delivered a package, and been rewarded with an amount of meat that was more-or-less proportional to the difficulty of the task. Hooray! Of course, there's obviously a bit more going on in that factory, but whether or not you want to mess around with all that is up to you.
