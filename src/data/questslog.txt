# Guild Quests
questG01Meatcar	My Other Car Is Made of Meat	Since your Guild's meat car has been lost due to somewhat sketchy circumstances, you need to build a new one. You might be able to find some parts at Degrassi Knoll.	You've built a new meat car from parts. Impressive!
questG02Whitecastle	<Player Name> and <Familiar Name> Go To White Citadel	You've been charged by your Guild (sort of) with the task of bringing back a delicious meal from the legendary White Citadel. You've been told it's somewhere near Whitey's Grove, in the Distant Woods.	You've discovered the road from Whitey's Grove to the legendary White Citadel. You should explore it and see if you can find your way.	You're progressing down the road towards the White Citadel, but you'll need to find something that can help you get past that stupid cheetah if you're going to make it any further. Keep looking around.	You've made your way further down the Road to the White Citadel, but you still haven't found it. Keep looking!	You've found the White Citadel, but it's at the bottom of a huge cliff. You should keep messing around on the Road until you find a way to get down the cliff.	You have discovered the legendary White Citadel. You should probably go in there and get the carryout order you were trying to get in the first place. Funny how things spiral out of control, isn't it?	You've got the Satisfaction Satchel. Take it to your contact in your Guild for a reward.	You've delivered a satchel of incredibly greasy food to someone you barely know. Plus, you can now shop at White Citadel whenever you want. Awesome!
questG03Ego	The Wizard of Ego	You've been tasked with digging up the grave of an ancient and powerful wizard and bringing back a key that was buried with him. What could possibly go wrong?	Well, you got the key and turned it in -- mission accomplished. How much do you wanna bet, though, that they won't be able to find anyone else to search the tower, and you'll be stuck with the dirty work again?	Much as you expected, you've been given back the key to Fernswarthy's tower and ordered to investigate.	You've unlocked Fernswarthy's tower. Now you just have to find something to show your guild leaders, to prove you haven't just been slacking off this whole time.	You've found some stairs in Fernswarthy's tower, but they don't lead to much. Better keep looking.	You've found a trapdoor to Fernswarthy's basement, which is potentially interesting and/or dangerous. It's probably not what your Guild is interested in, though, so you should probably keep looking.	You found some kind of dusty old book in Fernswarthy's tower. Hopefully that's enough to keep that guy in your guild off your case.	You've turned in the old book, and they said they didn't want it and for you to go away. A bit anticlimactic, but I suppose it still counts as a success. Congratulations!
questG04Nemesis	Me and My Nemesis	One of your guild leaders has tasked you to recover a mysterious and unnamed artifact stolen by your Nemesis. Your first step is to smith an Epic Weapon.<p>Two parts of the Epic Weapon can be had from the two oldest and wisest men in the kingdom, one of whom runs the casino. You weren't told where the third part is.	To unlock the full power of the Legendary Epic Weapon, you must defeat Beelzebozo, the Clown Prince of Darkness, in The "Fun" House.	You've finally killed the clownlord Beelzebozo -- you should head back to your guild and let them know!	You've successfully defeated Beelzebozo and claimed the last piece of the Legendary Epic Weapon -- congratulations! Now you just have to wait for your Guild to find out where your nemesis is hiding. Unfortunately, this might take a while. 	Your class leader back at the guild has <i>finally</i> discovered where your Nemesis is hiding. It took long enough, jeez! Anyway, turns out it's a Dark and Dank and Sinister Cave in the Big Mountains. Time to sort this jerk out, proper.	You have successfully shown your Nemesis what for, and claimed an ancient hat of power. It's pretty sweet.<p>Probably you should go tell your guild about this.	You showed the Epic Hat to the class leader back at your guild, but they didn't seem much impressed. I guess all this Nemesis nonsense isn't quite finished yet, but at least with your Nemesis in hiding again you won't have to worry about it for a while. That counts as a success, I think. Hooray!	It appears as though some nefarious ne'er-do-well has put a contract on your head!<p>Gee, I wonder who it could be... 	You handily dispatched some thugs who were trying to collect on your bounty, but something tells you they won't be the last ones to try.	Whoever put this hit out on you (like you haven't guessed already) has sent Mob Penguins to do their dirty work. Do you know any polar bears you could hire as bodyguards? No? Looks like you're on your own, then.	So much for those mob penguins that were after your head! If whoever put this hit out on you wants you killed (which, presumably, they do) they'll have to find some much more competent thugs.	Your suspicious[sic] have been confirmed: your Nemesis has put the order out for you to be hunted down and killed, and now they're sending their own guys instead of contracting out. Good luck! 	Bam! So much for your Nemesis' assassins! If that's the best they've got, you have nothing at all to worry about.<p>You sure hope that's the best they've got.	You had a run-in with some crazy mercenary or assassin or... thing that your Nemesis sent to do you in once and for all. A run-in followed by a run-out, evidently, but you're going to have to deal with this sooner or later. 	Now that you've dealt with your Nemesis' assassins and found a map to the secret tropical island volcano lair, it's time to take the fight to your foe. Booyah.	You've arrived at the secret tropical island volcano lair, and it's time to finally put a stop to this Nemesis nonsense once and for all. As soon as you can find where they're hiding. Maybe you can find someone to ask.	got away. Again.	Congratulations on solving the lava maze, which is probably the biggest pain-in-the-ass puzzle in the entire game! Hooray! (Unless you cheated, in which case: Boo!)	have some sort of crazy powerful and hideous final form? I was, but then I wrote all of this, so, y'know. 	Okay, now you've defeated your Nemesis once and for all! (Well, probably. Almost definitely.) Nevermore will the members of whichever class you're playing at the moment be hassled by that terrible entity! Way to go!
questG05Dark	A Dark and Dank and Sinister Quest	Finally it's time to meet this Nemesis you've been hearing so much about! The guy at your guild has marked your map with the location of a cave in the Big Mountains, where your Nemesis is supposedly hiding.	Having opened the first door in your Nemesis' cave, you are now faced with a second one. Go figure.	Having opened the second door in your Nemesis' cave, you are now of course faced with a third one. Hopefully this is the last one.	Woo! You're past the doors and it's time to stab some bastards	The door to your Nemesis' inner sanctum didn't seem to care for the password you tried earlier. Perhaps you should give the henchmen a stern talking to. And by "talking to" I mean... well, you know what I mean. 	Hear how the background music got all exciting? It's because you opened the door to your Nemesis' inner sanctum, and now it's time for a big dramatic fight! Good luck!	Your Nemesis has scuttled away in defeat, leaving you with a sweet Epic Hat and a feeling of smug superiority. Well done you!
questG06Delivery	<Player Name>'s Delivery Service	A guy in your guild has offered you some meat if you'll grab his package for him.<p>Oh stop laughing, you know perfectly well what I mean! Honestly...<p>Anyway, you should be able to find it in the 7-Foot Dwarves' factory complex, which can supposedly be reached through their mine.	You've successfully delivered a package, and been rewarded with an amount of meat that was more-or-less proportional to the difficulty of the task. Hooray! Of course, there's obviously a bit more going on in that factory, but whether or not you want to mess around with all that is up to you.
questG07Myst	Guilded Youth	Gorgonzola wants you to exorcise a poltersandwich in the Haunted Pantry.	Take the poltersandwich back to Gorgonzola at the League of Chef-Magi.
