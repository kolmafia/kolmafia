This package provides classes that allow to replicate existing 
repositories. The main class is <b>SVNRepositoryReplicator</b> that provides 
the necessary API to perform replication operations. It does not create 
a target repository if it doesn't exist yet, so, a user should take care of 
that by himself (although even here SVNKit can help him - please, read javadoc for the 
<A HREF="../../../../../org/tmatesoft/svn/core/io/SVNRepositoryFactory.html">SVNRepositoryFactory</A> 
class on how to create new blank FSFS-type repositories).
