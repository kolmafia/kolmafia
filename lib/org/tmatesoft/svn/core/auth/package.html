<p>
This package contains interfaces/classes used by the library to 
authenticate a user to a repository server. 

<p>
When a server pulls a client 
for credentials, <b>SVNRepository</b> driver invokes an authentication 
manager (<b>ISVNAuthenticationManager</b>) to ask for credentials.
Also an authentication manager provides and handles a lot of other 
repository acces-related options (proxy options, secure SSL contexts, etc.)
</p>

<p>
SVNKit gives a developer an ability either to implement his own 
authentication manager and provide it to <b>SVNRepository</b> drivers, 
or use a default implementation which functionality is more or less similar 
to the SVN command line client.
