/**
 * A Painter implementation that uses a Paint to fill the entire background
 * area. For example, if I wanted to paint the entire background of a panel green, I would:
 * <pre><code>
 *  MattePainter p = new MattePainter(Color.GREEN);
 *  panel.setBackgroundPainter(p);
 * </code></pre></p>
 * 
 * <p>Since it accepts a Paint, it is also possible to paint a texture or use other
 * more exotic Paint implementations. To paint a BufferedImage texture as the
 * background:
 * <pre><code>
 *  TexturePaint paint = new TexturePaint(bufferedImage,
 *      new Rectangle2D.Double(0, 0, bufferedImage.getWidth(), bufferedImage.getHeight()));
 *  MattePainter p = new MattePainter(paint);
 *  panel.setBackgroundPainter(p);
 * </code></pre></p>
 * 
 * <p>If no paint is specified, then nothing is painted</p>
