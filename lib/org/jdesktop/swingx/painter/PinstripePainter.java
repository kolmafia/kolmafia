/**
 * <p>A fun Painter that paints pinstripes. You can specify the Paint to paint
 * those pinstripes in (could even be a texture paint!), the angle at which
 * to paint the pinstripes, and the spacing between stripes.</p>
 *
 * <p>The default PinstripePainter configuration will paint the pinstripes
 * using the foreground color of the component (the default behavior if a
 * Paint is not specified) at a 45 degree angle with 8 pixels between stripes</p>
 *
 * <p>Here is a custom code snippet that paints Color.GRAY pinstripes at a 135
 * degree angle:
 * <pre><code>
 *  PinstripePainter p = new PinstripePainter();
 *  p.setAngle(135);
 *  p.setPaint(Color.GRAY);
 * </code></pre>
