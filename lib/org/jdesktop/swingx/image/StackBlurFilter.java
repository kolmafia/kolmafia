 * picture. The default number of iterations, 3, provides a decent compromise
 * between speed and rendering quality.</p>
 * <p>The force of the blur can be controlled with a radius and the
 * default radius is 3. Since the blur clamps values on the edges of the
 * source picture, you might need to provide a picture with empty borders
 * to avoid artifacts at the edges. The performance of this filter are
 * independant from the radius.</p>
