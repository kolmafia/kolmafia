Aw, dangit, you went and distracted me! I was remembering one of my favorite radio stories, and now I went and lost my place. I'll have to start over at the commercial, and now I'll have that stupid cigarette jingle stuck in my head all day! What do you want?<p>Currants? Them little raisin things that look like mouse turds? What d'you want to know about them for? What d'you think I know about that? Don't give me that look, of course I know what a mouse is! I may be aquatic, but I've read a book or two in my life, not like you kids these days with your moving pictures and text-phones where you can't use all the letters.<p>Oh, <i>currents</i>. Well you might have said so in the first place, instead of mumbling and talking to your shoes all the time! When I was a lad I knew how to look a fella in the eye when I talked to him! Anyway, yeah, we've got currents around here. Good strong ones too, not the little breezes you get most places these days. Johnny Two-Fingers got caught in one'a them once, carried him clear to Timbuktu and he had to hop a freight to get back. That's what he told us anyhow, but I was always suspicious of that on account of he was back before dinnertime. Johnny Two-Fingers was always makin' up fibs anyway. Told me once he taught a clam to whistle the national anthem, but he wouldn't show it to me on account of it havin' stage fright. Pfft! How's a clam whistle without lips anyway?<p>But yeah, them currents. Can't swim 'em, not less you wanna end up in Timbuktu. Legs ain't strong enough, certainly not a landlubber's legs like them things you got. Gonna need one of them seahorses like they keep at the Coral Corral. Lemme see that mess you call a map. Yeah, there's where it is, right there.<p>Now stop pestering me with all this nonsense about mouse turds so I can get back to my stories! 'Cancerfield cigarettes keep your T-zone smelling great! Soothe your throat and lungs with that fine sweetened menth - o - late!'<P><center><table  width=400  cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td style="color: white;" align=center bgcolor=blue><b>New Area Unlocked</b></td></tr><tr><td style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid blue;"><center><table><tr><td><center><table><tr><td valign=center><img src="https://d2uyhvukfffg5a.cloudfront.net/adventureimages/../otherimages/ocean/corrala.gif"></td><td valign=center class=small><b>The Coral Corral</b>, on <a class=nounder href=seafloor.php><b>The Sea Floor</b></a>.</td></tr></table></center></td></tr></table></center></td></tr><tr><td height=4></td></tr></table></center><p></td></tr></table></center></td></tr><tr><td height=4></td></tr></table><table  width=95%  cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td style="color: white;" align=center bgcolor=blue><b>Grandpa</b></td></tr><tr><td style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid blue;"><center><table><tr><td><center><img src="https://d2uyhvukfffg5a.cloudfront.net/adventureimages/sm_grandpawindow.gif" width=100 height=100><form name=grandpastories action=monkeycastle.php method=post><input type=hidden name=action value=grandpastory>&quot;Eh?
