The guardians left a clue as to its exact location -- a wooden model of Seaside Town, hidden in a smaller pyramid somewhere on Desert Beach. But to unlock the clue, I'll need the key. The legendary Staff of Ed!&quot; [picture: a pyramid at the edge of a vast desert]<br><br>Page 2<br>[picture: the three parts of the Staff of Ed -- a gem, an engraved ring, and a staff] &quot;The staff has been broken into 3 parts and scattered across the Kingdom. Once I have retrieved all three pieces, I must find the wooden city, and use the staff to determine the precise location of the pyramid.&quot; [picture: a cutaway view of the pyramid, showing sunlight, focused through the Staff of Ed, pinpointing a location on the wooden model]<br><br>Page 3<br>[picture: four small images in sequence: a forest, a stone with a map engraved on it, an ancient temple, and an image of an ancient god with long ears and a lightning-shaped tail] &quot;Bor 7: It is said that the Hidden Temple in the Distant Woods holds many ancient secrets. I have reason to believe that part of the Staff of Ed is hidden there. Bor 11: Discovered a passage about the Temple in a book on ancient religious architecture. Appears to contain notes about some kind of ritual. Significant?&quot;<br><br>Page 4<br>&quot;I: ALUTESAY MAJORES -- OWTHRAY VESTI MANUS IN AER ET AVEWAY LEMMA IKELAY TU NON CAUTIO (Trans: The Gesture of the Elders -- Throw your hands up in the air and wave them like you do not care.)

He refuses to see me, but I did discover a note left in a scrap of paper in a book he returned to the library across the street from the sleazy back alley. It contains, among other things, a fragment of sheet music. Curious.&quot; [picture: a fragment of sheet music]<br><br>Page 6<br>[picture: a bookshelf, with an arrow pointing to the third book from the left] [picture: a series of numerous strange glyphs]<br><br>Page 7<br><!--&quot;Bill 2: In a bar at the Obligatory Pirate's Cove, I overheard a pirate who claimed to have found the legendary Palindome. He was wearing an unusual gold amulet -- two snakes, each biting the other's tail. Unfortunately, I lost him in the crowd before I could question him.&quot; [picture: two snakes, combining to form an amulet] [note:  PASSWORD: swordfish] &quot;Bill 4: My research has revealed that the Palindome is the last resting place of the famed pool shark Rudolph &quot;Saturated&quot; Fats, or at least his pool cue, the Staff of Fats. It's widely rumored that it wasn't originally a pool cue, but that Fats had modified an old staff he had found in an antique store. This explains his pool prowess -- perhaps the cue is actually the shaft of the Staff of Ed!&quot;<br>-->&quot;Bill 2: &quot;My informant has revealed the locations of the two halves of the Talisman o' Namsilat, key to the legendary Palindome.  They are currently in the hands of the nefarious Copperhead brothers, Ron and Shen.  Shen was last seen at the Copperhead Club in Seaside Town, while Ron is rumored to have taken up with the Red Army at their mountain zeppelin base.&quot; [picture: two snakes, combining to form an amulet] [note:  PASSWORD: swordfish] &quot;Bill 4: My research has revealed that the Palindome is the last resting place of the famed pool shark Rudolph &quot;Saturated&quot; Fats, or at least his pool cue, the Staff of Fats.

They're not sure where it came from, and the bottom is missing. Still, it might be useful.&quot; [picture: the top part of a carving, with the words GOD, A RED NUGGET, A FAT EGG]<center><a href="inventory.php">Back to your Inventory</a></center></td></tr></table></center></td></tr><tr><td height=4></td></tr></table></center></body></html>
