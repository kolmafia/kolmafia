As you suspected, Lopez didn't build his hacienda right up against the mountain for reasons of simple defense, but also to provide an escape route through the underground tunnels. You quickly pick up his trail in the dirt and dust, and give chase. <p>Soon, the cavern branches into a smooth, almost glassy-surfaced tunnel -- obviously an ancient lava tube. It appears that you're heading directly into the heart of the volcano. On reflection, this was inevitable, really. I mean, you can't just have a Final Boss Battle <i>near</i> a volcano. It would be like having a car chase in which the fruit cart doesn't get knocked over. Or fighting crime in a giant robot and never using Rocket Punch.<p>You wipe the sweat from your face as the tunnel ends at a massive lake of bubbling lava. In the distance, through the shimmering haze of the heat, you spot a small island. You can just make out the form of your Nemesis -- at this distance you can't tell what he's up to, but 'no good' is a safe bet. You'd better get there fast and put a stop to it, whatever it is.<p>You survey the little stepping-stones that periodically rise and fall in the boiling magma, and realize that this is seriously going to suck. In fact, this is going to suck so much that I kind of feel like I ought to apologize in advance. Still, it wouldn't be a final battle without an especially fiendish final puzzle, now would it? <p><center><form method="get" action="volcanomaze.php?start=1"><input type="submit" class="button" value="Continue"></form></center></td></tr></table></center></td></tr><tr><td height=4></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></center></td></tr><tr><td height=4></td></tr></table></center></body></html>
