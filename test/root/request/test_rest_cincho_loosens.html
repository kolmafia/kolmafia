There is an indistinct humming noise, and everything begins to smell like cinnamon. Your mother approaches you, and whispers something in your ear.<p>"Devster5. Where is my music box?"<p>"Where are you?" you reply.<p>"There is a man in a smiling bag."<p>Something slithers by your foot as a flash of light blinds you, and then you are naked, miles above the earth. You look around, and find Humphrey Bogart sitting on a coffee table.<p>"Look both ways before crossing the street. The seal is broken. You know it to be true."<p>The place is familiar, like you've been here before, and then all you can see is a brass crown. You pick it up, and it vanishes suddenly, and thorny brambles cover the ground.<p>And then, carved stone faces gaze impassively at you everywhere you look and you begin to fall into darkness. You wake up in a cold sweat.</td></tr></table></center></td></tr><tr><td height=4></td></tr></table>
